Advent of Code

This is a collection of answers to the 2020 Advent of Code challange.

My goal with this is NOT to treat this as a competitive-level programing endeavour, but rather a learning experience. With that in mind, I tried to do each challange with these things in mind:

1.) I wanted to make clear and readable coode above all else
2.) I wanted to make the code as modular (using OOP) as possible
3.) I wanted to make the code re-usable if I ever encountered a similar problem in the future
4.) I wanted to gain as much practical development skills as I could that may not be 100% refelcted in the final release

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out!
