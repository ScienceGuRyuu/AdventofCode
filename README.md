# Advent of Code
This is a collection of answers to an every-growing list Advent of Code challange.

# I aim to 
* make clear and readable code
* make the code as modular as possible
* make the code re-usable if I ever encountered a similar problem in the future
* learn new lanquages and frameworks
* gain as much practical development skills as I could that may not be 100% refelcted in the final release

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out!
